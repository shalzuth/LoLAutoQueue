LoLAutoQueue
============

Auto queues up for LoL
This isn't ready 100% yet.

Latest compiled release: https://github.com/shalzuth/LoLAutoQueue/releases/download/v0.1-alpha/LoLAutoQueue.exe

Create acc.txt in the same folder as LoLAutoQueue.exe, format it as such:

accountName1 accountPassword region queueType

accountName2 accountPassword region queueType



Regions supported - https://github.com/shalzuth/LoLAutoQueue/blob/master/LoLAutoQueue/LoLAutoQueue/LoLLauncher/RTMP/Region.cs

Queues supported - INTRO_BOT, BEGINNER_BOT, MEDIUM_BOT, ARAM, CUSTOM

I would recommend trying out on Custom first to make sure you have settings correct. And to see if this program even works.

Credit goes to raler for the RTMP connection API.
